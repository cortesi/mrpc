# Development Notes

## README snippets

Code snippets in `README.md` are managed with `snips` to keep them checked and in sync with real
code in `./examples/`.

To update snippets locally, run `snips README.md` (or `snips` for all Markdown files).

See the `snips` repository: https://github.com/cortesi/snips
